I live in Granada, Spain with my s/o and our two cats, Haru and Maki. 

I've recently been reading sci-fi from Ursula K. Le Guin and fantasy from Terry Pratchett. Not long ago I read the Locked Tomb saga by Tamsyn Muir and loved it!

I work full time at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) from home, and I am the author of two courses at [CampusMVP](https://campusmvp.es).
